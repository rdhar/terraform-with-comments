# Terraform with Comments

## TL;DR

This reusable workflow enables you to plan and apply Terraform configurations with pull request (PR) comments for a CLI-like experience on the web. It's powered by GitHub Actions to maximize compatibility and minimize maintenance for DIY deployments.

## Overview

- [Terraform][terraform] is a platform-agnostic tool for managing cloud and on-prem resources by provisioning infrastructure as code (IaC).
  - It enables you to define resources in human-readable configuration files that can be version controlled and shared for consistent state management.
- [GitHub Actions][github_actions] is a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) platform that enables you to automate your project's pipelines with custom workflows.
  - This repository hosts a reusable workflow that parses PR comments and actions Terraform commands accordingly in a remote environment.
- Suited for Platform/DevOps engineers who want to empower their teams to self-service Terraform without the overhead of self-hosting runners, containers or VMs.
  - [Environment protection rules][deployment_rules] mitigate the risk of erroneous changes along with standardized approval requirements.
  - Each PR and associated workflow run holds a complete log of infrastructure changes for ease of collaborative debugging as well as audit compliance.
